# Connecting AWS
Tried to deploy the MERN app with AWS. Only tutorials I could find were like 3 years old, and many of them are outdated. I feel like I have set up everything, but I just cant figure out how to connect it all. Used PM2, NGINX, created an EC2 with Ubuntu. Ill add pictures to show what I tried to do.

Here is my EC2 ready. However, the IPv4 only leads to a 500 Internal Server Error

I am able to connect to the Ubuntu instance on AWS. I even connected to the terminal and run a few codes such as PM2 as shown below. Still cant connect my app though.
