# django-react-app

This is the initial project, nothing special. Create a python environment to make organization easier. 
It uses django and react so get those if you can. You need npm to install react. You also need node.js at some point.


## Get React
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/

### Open backend
To get started, pull the repository. Open two terminals. One should be open in the backend folder. The other should be open in the frontend folder.
From the terminal in the backend, run:
'''
npm install nodemon
npm install cors
npm run dev
'''

it will shows "connected to db & Listening on port" in terminal

### Open frontend
In the terminal open to the frontend, run:
'''
npm install sass
npm install react-icons
npm install react-virtualized
npm start
'''

This will automatically open up the link in your default browser.
